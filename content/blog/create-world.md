This tool randomly generates an overworld map for a fictional JRPG game. It's graphics are 8-bit/16-bit era. A new map generated every time the page is refreshed. You can choose from two different map sizes.

Here are preview images of the kind of maps you can generate with this tool:

## Update 2020-11-18: 

I re-coded the main part of this project in Rust, as a way to learn the language. It doesn't generate quite as fast as I'd expect, but that could be due to the PNG library I used and/or my beginner knowledge of Rust.

See [GitHub page here](https://github.com/rowlandrose/old_school_jrpg_map_generator). Runs in command line.
