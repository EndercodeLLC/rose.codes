The author of _The Finnish Way_ is an immigrant to Finland who fell in love with the country's culture and what the locals call "Sisu." She compiles a set of related life-lessons she's gained. It's an easy read and I enjoyed it. I've incorporated some of the lessons of this book into my own life, including fun ones like cold-dipping.

I'll start out with a chapter synopsis. Not neccessarily complete. Just as I personally interpretted. Then I'll give my personal takeaways from this book. Then I'll make a general assessment and recommendation of the book.

## Chapter 1
- Cycle or walk to work or school
- Approach chores such as cleaning as a workout
- First try to fix items before throwing away and buying new.
- Buy things that last.
- Take stairs instead of elevator
- Embrace nature, whatever the weather or season

## Chapter 2
- Strive for Sisu - mental toughness, fortitude, resilience. Stubborn courageous attitude. Transforms challenges into opportunities.
- "*How* can I do this?" Instead of "I can't" or "I won't"
- Good health and well-being can help build up Sisu.

## Chapter 3
- 30 to 60 second dip into 4 degree Celsius water has many health benefits
  - Improves cold tolerance
  - Improves immunity
  - Gives pain relief
  - It's a natural stimulant
  - Provides stress relief
- But don't do it if you are
  - Sick
  - Suffering from heart condition, high blood pressure, asthma
- Consider neoprene slippers, flip-flops, or wool socks as you walk to the water.

## Chapter 4
- The goal of a sauna is to relax both body and mind
- Even a few minutes in the hot steam can work
- Sauna Etiquette
  - There are no rules about how long to sit in the sauna
  - Stay hydrated by drinking water
  - Always ask the other sauna-goers if it's all right before puring the loylly (water ladle) on the hot rocks.
  - You can wrap up in a towel or be naked (if you're brave)

## Chapter 5
- Being in nature can reduce stress and anxiety and alleviate mild depression, even a 15 min walk in a park or forest or shoreline.
- Try digital detox by putting screens on silent when in nature.
- Focus on surroundings and be present. Notice color of tree leaves or flowers. Helps to take a break from whatever is on your mind.
- It is a way to recharge Sisu.

## Chapter 6
- Food plate should be 1/2 veggies, 1/4 starches, 1/4 protein.
- Grocery cart should probably be same ratio
- Rainbow method - How many colors are represented by items on plate? Generally more = better
- Add fruits and berries to morning oatmeal or cereal, or just eat them direct
- Drink water as your drink of choice
- Grow some of your own produce

## Chapter 7
- Unstructured outdoor play, rain or shine, is important for kids. Weather should not be an excuse.
- Encourage a connection with nature in kids. Let them climb, jump and run outdoors.
- Let kids build their own stuff out of used items like cereal boxes instead of buying new toys
- Play is how kids learn
- Cultivate a supportive environment for not giving up

## Chapter 8
- Cycling has many health benefits
- Counters effects of sedentary lifestyle
- Elevates mood
- Provides stress relief
- Boosts creativity
- Boosts brain power
- Cycling can save time & money compared to owning and maintaining a car
- Keep cycling enjoyable. Even shorter distances are great.
- Find cycling friends
- Research bike-friendly trails in area
- Consider the positive experience of author in an area with significant biking infrastructure.

## Chapter 9
- Movement is medicine. Find opportunities to move and exercise in every-day life. Sprinkle movement across your day.

## Chapter 10
- Instead of buying or outsourcing a well-being service, can you do it yourself or with a friend?
- Is buying secondhand an option?
- Where will item go when I' done with it? Can it be donated or resold?
- Invest in a few quality, well-made items that will last.
- Make the effort to design a more functional lifestyle where possible. This is an act of Sisu. Can anything be downsized without adversely affecting you or your family, that could reduce maintenance costs or commute time?

Here are things that stood out to me personally after reading _The Finnish Way_:

- It would be amazing to live in a place that was TRULY bike-friendly. Imaging biking to work, to stores, to family and friends, without worrying about cars. I'm in Granger, Indiana right now, and while there are some new bike paths that are truly great, there is a lot of room for improvement, both in Granger and the surrounding South Bend / Mishawaka / Elkhart area.
- Chores are also workouts
- Nature should be enjoyed no matter the season or weather, which is doable when properly prepared for
- Cold dips and Sauna are healthy for body & mind
- Sometimes we need a digital detox
- A healthy diet is 1/2 veggie, 1/4 starch, 1/4 protein
- Play is how kids learn, and outdoor play the traditional and most healthy way that happens. Kids need a lot of unstructured play.
- Intentionally sprinkle your day with movement.
- Be concerned about health and sustainability, both personal and at a society level.

I actually read this book a couple years ago. Here are the lessons that I still apply to my life to this day:

- Taking cold dips. Lake Michigan is great for this! Just don't go when there's significant ice. And don't go alone. Most of the time it's simply me dipping in a cold bath. I've even had the kids (voluntarily of course) join me on some cold dips. They loved it!
- I've made permanent changes to my diet that include avoiding all the added sugars, processed grains, and dairy that are in our food. It's made significant improvements in my health. I encourage people to work hard at building a diet for themselves that makes them happy and healthy. Everyone is different so it takes research. But this book played a part in my journey.
- I always keep in mind that my kids need some outdoor time. We went camping 6 times this year!
- Screentime limits remain important in my family.

## Final Thoughts

I recommend this book to any American sick of the default diet and behaviors that our culture tries to make you emulate. If you want to take a step toward being more intentional in your self-care, this book is an easy read, and a fascinating glimpse into some unique and positive aspects of Finnish culture.
