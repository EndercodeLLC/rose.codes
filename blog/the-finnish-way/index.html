<p>The author of <em>The Finnish Way</em> is an immigrant to Finland who fell in love with the country's culture and what the locals call &quot;Sisu.&quot; She compiles a set of related life-lessons she's gained. It's an easy read and I enjoyed it. I've incorporated some of the lessons of this book into my own life, including fun ones like cold-dipping. </p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I'll start out with a chapter synopsis. Not neccessarily complete. Just as I personally interpretted. Then I'll give my personal takeaways from this book. Then I'll make a general assessment and recommendation of the book.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h2>
<ul>
<li>Movement is medicine. Find opportunities to move and exercise in every-day life. Sprinkle movement across your day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of buying or outsourcing a well-being service, can you do it yourself or with a friend?</li>
<li>Is buying secondhand an option?</li>
<li>Where will item go when I' done with it? Can it be donated or resold?</li>
<li>Invest in a few quality, well-made items that will last.</li>
<li>Make the effort to design a more functional lifestyle where possible. This is an act of Sisu. Can anything be downsized without adversely affecting you or your family, that could reduce maintenance costs or commute time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are things that stood out to me personally after reading <em>The Finnish Way</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be amazing to live in a place that was TRULY bike-friendly. Imaging biking to work, to stores, to family and friends, without worrying about cars. I'm in Granger, Indiana right now, and while there are some new bike paths that are truly great, there is a lot of room for improvement, both in Granger and the surrounding South Bend / Mishawaka / Elkhart area.</li>
<li>Chores are also workouts</li>
<li>Nature should be enjoyed no matter the season or weather, which is doable when properly prepared for</li>
<li>Cold dips and Sauna are healthy for body &amp; mind</li>
<li>Sometimes we need a digital detox</li>
<li>A healthy diet is 1/2 veggie, 1/4 starch, 1/4 protein</li>
<li>Play is how kids learn, and outdoor play the traditional and most healthy way that happens. Kids need a lot of unstructured play.</li>
<li>Intentionally sprinkle your day with movement.</li>
<li>Be concerned about health and sustainability, both personal and at a society level.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually read this book a couple years ago. Here are the lessons that I still apply to my life to this day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking cold dips. Lake Michigan is great for this! Just don't go when there's significant ice. And don't go alone. Most of the time it's simply me dipping in a cold bath. I've even had the kids (voluntarily of course) join me on some cold dips. They loved it!</li>
<li>I've made permanent changes to my diet that include avoiding all the added sugars, processed grains, and dairy that are in our food. It's made significant improvements in my health. I encourage people to work hard at building a diet for themselves that makes them happy and healthy. Everyone is different so it takes research. But this book played a part in my journey.</li>
<li>I always keep in mind that my kids need some outdoor time. We went camping 6 times this year!</li>
<li>Screentime limits remain important in my family.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I recommend this book to any American sick of the default diet and behaviors that our culture tries to make you emulate. If you want to take a step toward being more intentional in your self-care, this book is an easy read, and a fascinating glimpse into some unique and positive aspects of Finnish culture.</p>
<p>If you buy the book with this link I'll get a small commision.</p>
